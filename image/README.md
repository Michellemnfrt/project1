#Project #1 Memory Card Built With Javascript and CSS

## Purpose

The Goal of this project is to create a functional memory card game that allows you to flip two different cards and assess to see if they match. If they do match both cards should disappear. If they do not match they should flip back over.

###The logic behind the game is as follows

1.  Add function to all cards so that the click does something // duplicate the alternative photos for the face of the cards //
2.  Change picture when clicked (create function to do this)
3.  Add Event Listener
4.  Keep first clicked picture displayed // compare second picture to first picture //
5.  If there is a match make them dissapear //
6.  If there is no match make them flip back over
7.  Repeat steps 5 and 6 until there are no cards left //
8.  Alert game over
